Histopathological Image Segmenter and Classifier

---
Histopathological image analysis, including biopsy image segmentation and classification, is an important field in digital pathology that uses advanced computational techniques to analyze microscopic images of tissue samples. This process aids pathologists in diagnosing diseases, particularly cancer.

This Model aims to achieve highly accurate cell segmentation and classification - to aid the study of histopathology .
